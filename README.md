# Currency Converter Vanilla JS

Currency converter is a web application built around vanilla JS and lit-html as a template engine.
Current version support Latest Major Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge and Opera).
I used Forex Exchange rates API to calculate the currencies.

**NB: If you need support for IE11 you can replace lit-html with another template engine like pug.**

Keep calm and code!
